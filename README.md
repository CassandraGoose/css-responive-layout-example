### Example HTML and CSS that was used in my lesson of Responsive Layouts on July 15, 2021.

### To use:
- open the index file as you would normally 
- uncomment the types HTML example and then uncomment the layout CSS that you would like to see
- to see a media query example, uncomment the media query HTML and the matching media query CSS. 

### Note:
This is used for example purposes only and doesn't necessarily include best practices. (For example, maybe don't set the height and width on the body to 100vh/100vw IRL)
